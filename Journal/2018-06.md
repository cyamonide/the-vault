### 9:17 PM (GMT+8) | Maternal grandparents' house | Beijing
Dad is probably having dinner right now, at his university colleagues' reunion. Mom, Vincent, and my grandma are asleep. Grandpa is washing up. I've decided to pitch camp in the living room, waiting for Dad's return. He's not one to drink, but he better not have fallen asleep and missed the bus stop, or have gotten lost.

This morning I had my blood drawn and peed in a cup for a checkup. I feared the needle, especially after three vaccination shots one after the other (a few weeks ago). It's not just a stinging pain on the surface, but one that's deep too. To be honest, it didn't hurt as much as it bothered me that there was a long ass stick of metal in my arm. It's done now, so I'm a happy camper.

#### Food for thought
There are four Chinese characters framed and hung up in the living room. I cannot understand them for I can barely read, but my mother can so she explains to me. Something along the lines of "_without solitary thought, in peace and quiet, one will be unable to find their way_."
