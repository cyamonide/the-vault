# OpenGL

Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) is an API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. Usually interacts with a GPU for hardware-accelerated rendering.

[Krhonos](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Getting_Started)

All OpenGL bindings (C#, Java, Python, Lua, etc.) are based off the C/C++ bindings.

If you are using C++, set up a build environment first (VS project, GNU makefile, CMake file, etc.) that can link to OpenGL.

In Windows, you need to statically link to a library called OpenGL32.lib (the 32 is meaningless; use it on x64 as well).
