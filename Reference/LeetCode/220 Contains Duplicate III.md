# 220. Contains Duplicate III

Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices _i_ and _j_ in the array such that the __absolute__ difference between __nums[i]__ and __nums[j]__ is at most _t_ and the __absolute__ difference between _i_ and _j_ is at most _k_.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
```

__Example 3:__
```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
```
