Personal repository for everything competitive programming related.  
I used this repository extensively during high school, but no longer. Now, I have dedicated private repositories to host code related to the contests I actively participate in, such as Google CodeJam.

Some directories (such as `Project Euler`) contain code not intended as a guide or solution for those stuck on a problem. Rather, exploring my methods and approaches to problems is encouraged when comparing them to your own. This is an honour system; respect it.
