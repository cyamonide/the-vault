Some directories (such as `Project Euler`) contain code not intended as a guide or solution for those stuck on a problem. Rather, exploring my methods and approaches to problems is encouraged when comparing them to your own. This is an honour system; respect it.

You should learn from your competitor, but never copy. Copy and you die. --Jack Ma
